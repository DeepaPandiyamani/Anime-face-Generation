# 🎭 FaceGen — Anime Face Generation using DCGAN

FaceGen is a deep learning mini-project that uses **Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN)** to generate high-quality, realistic **anime-style faces**. It involves training a generative model to learn the complex patterns of anime characters using adversarial learning.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project explores the capabilities of **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** in synthesizing anime images from random noise. It includes data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, and performance evaluation.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* 🎨 Generates realistic anime-style faces.
* 🔁 Trained using adversarial learning on a large anime image dataset.
* ⚙️ Built with TensorFlow and Keras.
* 📈 Evaluated visually and numerically to assess image realism and diversity.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **TensorFlow & Keras**
* **NumPy, Matplotlib**
* **DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN)**

---

## 📊 Model Architecture

* **Generator**: Transforms random noise vectors into 64x64 RGB images using transpose convolution layers.
* **Discriminator**: Classifies real vs. generated images using CNN layers.

---

## 📈 Training

* Images are normalized to \[-1, 1].
* Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy
* Optimizers:

  * Generator: Adam (lr=0.0003)
  * Discriminator: Adam (lr=0.0001)
* Epochs: 50
